## Overview

The SAFE Toolbox MVP is a prototype web application designed to serve individuals in recovery, returning citizens, and justice-impacted communities. It offers real-time access to critical resources such as housing, mental health services, treatment programs, and recovery support groups. 

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this MVP is lightweight, fast, and mobile-friendly—ready for expansion into a fully dynamic WordPress platform or custom web app.
